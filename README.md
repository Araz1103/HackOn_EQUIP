Team "High on Caffeine" - Presentation

Team Idea/Problem :
A program which aids teachers and students in online classes to share absorbing lessons. 
Using our custom algorithm, creating questions from school chapters, and feeding it into popular quiz software like kahoot. This is extremely beneficial for the Covid environment, where students have no alternative to online classes, and our tool helps to make them relevant, interesting & helps retain what students study! Refer to PPT

Inspiration:
As some members of our team are school students, we have personal experience with long, tedious classes, that are so through no fault of the teacher. Looking to try and improve this situation through zoom classes, we have tried to present a solution that we wish would be implemented in our own classes.

Technology Used:

Used Libraries - Python, NLP Libraries like spaCy, Universal Sentence Encoder by Tensorflow, NLTK, YAKE, RAKE, TF-IDF
