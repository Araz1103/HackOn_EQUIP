              "'Mary in the library\\nAs the bell rang, the teacher asked the students to follow\\nhim, because they were going to the library for the first\\ntime. When Mary stepped inside, she found that the\\nlibrary was much larger than their classroom. And there\\nwere so many shelves, all full of books. In one corner\\nwas a cupboard filled with large, old volumes. Seeing\\nher trying to open the cupboard, the teacher said, “That\\ncupboard has very special books on different religions.\\nDid you know that we have a set of the Vedas?”\\nWhat are the Vedas? Mary wondered. Let us find out\\nOne of the oldest books in the world\\nYou may have heard about the Vedas. There are\\nfour of them – the Rigveda, Samaveda, Yajurveda\\nand Atharvaveda. The oldest Veda is the Rigveda,\\ncomposed about 3500 years ago. The Rigveda\\nincludes more than a thousand hymns, called\\nsukta or “well-said”. These hymns are in praise\\nof various gods and goddesses. Three gods are\\nespecially important: Agni, the god of fire; Indra,\\na warrior god; and Soma, a plant from which a\\nspecial drink was prepared.\\nThese hymns were composed by sages (rishis).\\nPriests taught students to recite and memorise\\neach syllable, word, and sentence, bit by bit, with\\ngreat care. Most of the hymns were composed,\\ntaught and learnt by men. A few were composed\\nby women. The Rigveda is in old or Vedic Sanskrit,\\nwhich is different from the Sanskrit you learn in\\nschool these days.\\nSanskrit and other languages\\nSanskrit is part of a family of languages known as Indo-European.\\nSome Indian languages such as Assamese, Gujarati, Hindi, Kashmiri\\nand Sindhi; Asian languages such as Persian and many European\\nlanguages such as English, French, German, Greek, Italian and\\nSpanish belong to this family. They are called a family because they\\noriginally had words in common.\\nTake the words ‘matr’ (Sanskrit), ‘ma’ (Hindi) and ‘mother’ (English).\\nDo you notice any similarities?\\nOther languages used in the subcontinent belong to different\\nfamilies. For instance, those used in the north-east belong to the\\nTibeto-Burman family; Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam belong\\nto the Dravidian family; and the languages spoken in Jharkhand and\\nparts of central India belong to the Austro-Asiatic family.\\nList the languages you have heard about and try and identify the\\nfamilies to which they belong.\\nThe books we use are written and printed. The\\nRigveda was recited and heard rather than read.\\nIt was written down several centuries after it was\\nfirst composed, and printed less than 200 years\\nago.\\nHow historians study the Rigveda\\nHistorians, like archaeologists, find out about the\\npast, but, in addition to material remains, they\\nexamine written sources as well. Let us see how\\nthey study the Rigveda.\\nSome of the hymns in the Rigveda are in the\\nform of dialogues. This is part of one such hymn,\\na dialogue between a sage named Vishvamitra,\\nand two rivers, (Beas and Sutlej) that were\\nworshipped as goddesses.\\nFind the rivers on Map 1 (page 2), then read on:\\nA page from a\\nmanuscript of the\\nRigveda.\\nThis manuscript of the\\nRigveda, on birch bark,\\nwas found in Kashmir.\\nAbout 150 years ago, it\\nwas used to prepare one\\nof the earliest printed\\ntexts of the Rigveda, as\\nwell as an English\\ntranslation. It is now\\npreserved in a library in\\nPune, Maharashtra.\\nVishvamitra and the Rivers\\nVishvamitra: O rivers, come down from the mountains like two swift horses, like\\ntwo shining cows that lick their calves.\\nYou move like chariots to the sea, through the power of Indra. You are full of\\nwater and wish to unite with one another.\\nThe rivers: We, who are full of water, move along the path the gods have made\\nfor us. Once we start flowing, we cannot be stopped. Why do you pray to us, o\\nsage?\\nVishvamitra: O sisters, please listen to me, the singer who has come from a\\ndistance with his chariots and carts. Let your waters not rise above our axles, so\\nthat we can cross safely.\\nThe rivers: We will listen to your prayers so that you can cross safely.\\nHistorians point out that this hymn was composed in the area where\\nthese rivers flow. They also suggest that the sage lived in a society where\\nhorses and cows were valued animals. That is why the rivers are compared\\nto horses and cows.\\nDo you think chariots were also important? Give reasons for your answer.\\nRead the verses and find out what are the modes of transport that are\\nmentioned.\\nOther rivers, especially the Indus and its other tributaries, and the\\nSarasvati, are also named in the hymns. The Ganga and Yamuna are\\nnamed only once.\\nLook at Map 1 (page 2) and list 5 rivers that are not mentioned in the\\nRigveda.\\nCattle, horses and chariots\\nThere are many prayers in the Rigveda for cattle,\\nchildren (especially sons), and horses. Horses\\nwere yoked to chariots that were used in battles,\\nwhich were fought to capture cattle. Battles were\\nalso fought for land, which was important for\\npasture, and for growing hardy crops that ripened\\nquickly, such as barley. Some battles were fought\\nfor water, and to capture people.\\nSome of the wealth that was obtained was kept\\nby the leaders, some was given to the priests and\\nthe rest was distributed amongst the people. Some\\nwealth was used for the performance of yajnas or\\nsacrifices in which offerings were made into the\\nfire. These were meant for gods and goddesses.\\nOfferings could include ghee, grain, and in some\\ncases, animals.\\nMost men took part in these wars. There was\\nno regular army, but there were assemblies where\\npeople met and discussed matters of war and\\npeace. They also chose leaders, who were often\\nbrave and skilful warriors.\\nWords to describe people\\nThere are several ways of describing people — in\\nterms of the work they do, the language they\\nspeak, the place they belong to, their family, their\\ncommunities and cultural practices. Let us see\\nsome of the words used to describe people found\\nin the Rigveda.\\nThere are two groups who are described in\\nterms of their work — the priests, sometimes\\ncalled brahmins, who performed various rituals,\\nand the rajas.\\nThese rajas were not like the ones you will be\\nlearning about later. They did not have capital\\ncities, palaces or armies, nor did they collect taxes.\\nGenerally, sons did not automatically succeed\\nfathers as rajas.\\nRead the previous section once more and see\\nwhether you can find out what the rajas did.\\nTwo words were used to describe the people or\\nthe community as a whole. One was the word\\njana, which we still use in Hindi and other\\nlanguages. The other was vish. The word vaishya\\ncomes from vish. You will learn more about this\\nin Chapter 5.\\nSeveral vish or jana are mentioned by name.\\nSo we find reference to the Puru jana or vish, the\\nBharata jana or vish, the Yadu jana or vish, and\\nso on.\\nDo any of these names sound familiar?\\nSometimes, the people who composed the\\nhymns described themselves as Aryas and called\\ntheir opponents Dasas or Dasyus. These were\\npeople who did not perform sacrifices, and\\nprobably spoke different languages. Later, the\\nterm dasa (and the feminine dasi) came to mean\\nslave.

              "'Mary in the library\\nAs the bell rang, the teacher asked the students to follow\\nhim, because they were going to the library for the first\\ntime. When Mary stepped inside, she found that the\\nlibrary was much larger than their classroom. And there\\nwere so many shelves, all full of books. In one corner\\nwas a cupboard filled with large, old volumes. Seeing\\nher trying to open the cupboard, the teacher said, “That\\ncupboard has very special books on different religions.\\nDid you know that we have a set of the Vedas”?#$\\nWhat are the Vedas?#$ Mary wondered. Let us find out\\nOne of the oldest books in the world\\nYou may have heard about the Vedas. There are\\nfour of them – the Rigveda, Samaveda, Yajurveda\\nand Atharvaveda. The oldest Veda is the Rigveda,\\ncomposed about 3500 years ago. The Rigveda\\nincludes more than a thousand hymns, called\\nsukta or “well-said”. These hymns are in praise\\nof various gods and goddesses. Three gods are\\nespecially important: Agni, the god of fire; Indra,\\na warrior god; and Soma, a plant from which a\\nspecial drink was prepared.\\nThese hymns were composed by sages (rishis).\\nPriests taught students to recite and memorise\\neach syllable, word, and sentence, bit by bit, with\\ngreat care. Most of the hymns were composed,\\ntaught and learnt by men. A few were composed\\nby women. The Rigveda is in old or Vedic Sanskrit,\\nwhich is different from the Sanskrit you learn in\\nschool these days.\\nSanskrit and other languages\\nSanskrit is part of a family of languages known as Indo-European.\\nSome Indian languages such as Assamese, Gujarati, Hindi, Kashmiri\\nand Sindhi; Asian languages such as Persian and many European\\nlanguages such as English, French, German, Greek, Italian and\\nSpanish belong to this family. They are called a family because they\\noriginally had words in common.\\nTake the words ‘matr’ (Sanskrit), ‘ma’ (Hindi) and ‘mother’ (English).\\nDo you notice any similarities?#$\\nOther languages used in the subcontinent belong to different\\nfamilies. For instance, those used in the north-east belong to the\\nTibeto-Burman family; Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam belong\\nto the Dravidian family; and the languages spoken in Jharkhand and\\nparts of central India belong to the Austro-Asiatic family.\\nList the languages you have heard about and try and identify the\\nfamilies to which they belong.\\nThe books we use are written and printed. The\\nRigveda was recited and heard rather than read.\\nIt was written down several centuries after it was\\nfirst composed, and printed less than 200 years\\nago.\\nHow historians study the Rigveda\\nHistorians, like archaeologists, find out about the\\npast, but, in addition to material remains, they\\nexamine written sources as well. Let us see how\\nthey study the Rigveda.\\nSome of the hymns in the Rigveda are in the\\nform of dialogues. This is part of one such hymn,\\na dialogue between a sage named Vishvamitra,\\nand two rivers, (Beas and Sutlej) that were\\nworshipped as goddesses.\\nFind the rivers on Map 1 (page 2), then read on:\\nA page from a\\nmanuscript of the\\nRigveda.\\nThis manuscript of the\\nRigveda, on birch bark,\\nwas found in Kashmir.\\nAbout 150 years ago, it\\nwas used to prepare one\\nof the earliest printed\\ntexts of the Rigveda, as\\nwell as an English\\ntranslation. It is now\\npreserved in a library in\\nPune, Maharashtra.\\nVishvamitra and the Rivers\\nVishvamitra: O rivers, come down from the mountains like two swift horses, like\\ntwo shining cows that lick their calves.\\nYou move like chariots to the sea, through the power of Indra. You are full of\\nwater and wish to unite with one another.\\nThe rivers: We, who are full of water, move along the path the gods have made\\nfor us. Once we start flowing, we cannot be stopped. Why do you pray to us, o\\nsage?#$\\nVishvamitra: O sisters, please listen to me, the singer who has come from a\\ndistance with his chariots and carts. Let your waters not rise above our axles, so\\nthat we can cross safely.\\nThe rivers: We will listen to your prayers so that you can cross safely.\\nHistorians point out that this hymn was composed in the area where\\nthese rivers flow. They also suggest that the sage lived in a society where\\nhorses and cows were valued animals. That is why the rivers are compared\\nto horses and cows.\\nDo you think chariots were also important?#$ Give reasons for your answer.\\nRead the verses and find out what are the modes of transport that are\\nmentioned.\\nOther rivers, especially the Indus and its other tributaries, and the\\nSarasvati, are also named in the hymns. The Ganga and Yamuna are\\nnamed only once.\\nLook at Map 1 (page 2) and list 5 rivers that are not mentioned in the\\nRigveda.\\nCattle, horses and chariots\\nThere are many prayers in the Rigveda for cattle,\\nchildren (especially sons), and horses. Horses\\nwere yoked to chariots that were used in battles,\\nwhich were fought to capture cattle. Battles were\\nalso fought for land, which was important for\\npasture, and for growing hardy crops that ripened\\nquickly, such as barley. Some battles were fought\\nfor water, and to capture people.\\nSome of the wealth that was obtained was kept\\nby the leaders, some was given to the priests and\\nthe rest was distributed amongst the people. Some\\nwealth was used for the performance of yajnas or\\nsacrifices in which offerings were made into the\\nfire. These were meant for gods and goddesses.\\nOfferings could include ghee, grain, and in some\\ncases, animals.\\nMost men took part in these wars. There was\\nno regular army, but there were assemblies where\\npeople met and discussed matters of war and\\npeace. They also chose leaders, who were often\\nbrave and skilful warriors.\\nWords to describe people\\nThere are several ways of describing people — in\\nterms of the work they do, the language they\\nspeak, the place they belong to, their family, their\\ncommunities and cultural practices. Let us see\\nsome of the words used to describe people found\\nin the Rigveda.\\nThere are two groups who are described in\\nterms of their work — the priests, sometimes\\ncalled brahmins, who performed various rituals,\\nand the rajas.\\nThese rajas were not like the ones you will be\\nlearning about later. They did not have capital\\ncities, palaces or armies, nor did they collect taxes.\\nGenerally, sons did not automatically succeed\\nfathers as rajas.\\nRead the previous section once more and see\\nwhether you can find out what the rajas did.\\nTwo words were used to describe the people or\\nthe community as a whole. One was the word\\njana, which we still use in Hindi and other\\nlanguages. The other was vish. The word vaishya\\ncomes from vish. You will learn more about this\\nin Chapter 5.\\nSeveral vish or jana are mentioned by name.\\nSo we find reference to the Puru jana or vish, the\\nBharata jana or vish, the Yadu jana or vish, and\\nso on.\\nDo any of these names sound familiar?#$\\nSometimes, the people who composed the\\nhymns described themselves as Aryas and called\\ntheir opponents Dasas or Dasyus. These were\\npeople who did not perform sacrifices, and\\nprobably spoke different languages. Later, the\\nterm dasa (and the feminine dasi) came to mean\\nslave. Slaves were women and men who were often\\ncaptured in war. They were treated as the property\\nof their owners, who could make them do\\nwhatever work they wanted.\\nWhile the Rigveda was being composed in the\\nnorth-west of the subcontinent, there were other\\ndevelopments elsewhere.

            " The practice of erecting megaliths began about 3000 years ago, and was prevalent throughout the Deccan, south India, in the north-east and Kashmir. Let us find out One of the oldest books in the world You may have heard about the Vedas. The Rigveda was recited and heard rather than read. These hymns were composed by sages (rishis). It is now preserved in a library in Pune, Maharashtra. The oldest Veda is the Rigveda, composed about 3500 years ago. It was written down several centuries after it was first composed, and printed less than 200 years ago. There are four of them – the Rigveda, Samaveda, Yajurveda and Atharvaveda. While the Rigveda was being composed in the north-west of the subcontinent, there were other developments elsewhere. Let us see how they study the Rigveda What are the Vedas?. The Rigveda is in old or Vedic Sanskrit, which is different from the Sanskrit you learn in school these days. The Rigveda includes more than a thousand hymns, called sukta or “well-said”. Some of the hymns in the Rigveda are in the form of dialogues. About 2000 years ago, there was a famous physician named Charaka who wrote a book on medicine known as the Charaka Samhita Did you know that we have a set of the Vedas”?. Let us see some of the words used to describe people found in the Rigveda. Three gods are especially important: Agni, the god of fire; Indra, a warrior god; and Soma, a plant from which a special drink was prepared. This manuscript of the Rigveda, on birch bark, was found in Kashmir. These were meant for gods and goddesses. List one difference between the raja of the Rigveda and these kings. It was occupied between 3600 and 2700 years ago. How historians study the Rigveda Historians, like archaeologists, find out about the past, but, in addition to material remains, they examine written sources as well. These hymns are in praise of various gods and goddesses. Around 3500 years ago, we find some of the first evidence of writing in China. About 150 years ago, it was used to prepare one of the earliest printed texts of the Rigveda, as well as an English translation\n",
